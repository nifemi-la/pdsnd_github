### Project Information
This project was created on April 9th 2024. This file was created April 19, 2024 in alignement with the second project in the UDACITY Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program.

### Bikeshare Project- Explore US Bikeshare Data 
The Bikeshare project analyzes bikeshare data from several cities to provide insights into bike usage patterns and trends.

### Project details 
In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate(opens in a new tab), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Our Datasets
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

### Statistics Computed
In this project, I have written code to provide the following information:
_1. Popular times of travel_
- the most common month
- the most common day of week
- the most common hour of day
_2. Popular stations and trip_
- the most common start station
- the most common end station
- the most common trip from start to end
_3. Trip duration_
- the total travel time
- the average travel time
_4. User info_
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (available for only NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (available only for NYC and Chicago)

### Files required 
To answer these questions using Python, I have written a Python script saves as **bikeshare.py** file, and you will do your scripting in there also. We will need the three city dataset files too:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
